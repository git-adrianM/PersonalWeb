        hey hey hey! i'm someone who's a bit all over the place. i love all
        things tech, art, fashion, walkable cities, food, and so much more.
        sometimes i feel like a sponge, going around and learning as much as i
        can from the amazing people around me &#129533;.

        i'm a serial hobby hopper, i dabble in the arts, i stay fit, and i'm
        currently on the quest for a perfect cup of coffee. my existence in so
        many things really helped shape the learner that i am today, and the one
        i'll be tomorrow!
